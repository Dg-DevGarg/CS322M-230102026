# Vending Machine Controller (Mealy FSM)

##  Overview 
The machine accepts coins of **5** and **10**, represented by a 2-bit input:

- `coin = 2'b01` → 5  
- `coin = 2'b10` → 10  
- `coin = 2'b00` → no coin  
- `coin = 2'b11` → ignore  
 The FSM determines when to **dispense** the product and if to return **5 change**.

## Why Mealy?
The design is implemented as a **Mealy machine** instead of a Moore machine because:

- In a Mealy FSM, **outputs depend on both the state and the current input**, allowing faster response.  
- This is ideal for vending machines since the product can be dispensed **immediately when the last coin is inserted**, without waiting for an extra clock cycle.  
- A Moore FSM would require waiting until the *next state* transition before dispensing, adding unnecessary delay.  

Thus, Mealy FSM provides **efficient, real-time response** in coin detection and product dispensing.

## 🔄 State Encoding
- `S0` → 0 inserted  
- `S1` → 5 inserted  
- `S2` → 10 inserted  
- `S3` → 15 inserted  

---

## State Transitions
- From **S0**:  
  - +5 → S1  
  - +10 → S2  

- From **S1**:  
  - +5 → S2  
  - +10 → S3  

- From **S2**:  
  - +5 → S3  
  - +10 → Dispense immediately, reset to S0  

- From **S3**:  
  - +5 → Dispense immediately, reset to S0  
  - +10 → Dispense + return ₹5 change, reset to S0  

---

##  Output Logic
- **Dispense**:
  - When total ≥ 20 (achieved either by exact 20 or by overpayment).  
- **Change (chg5)**:
  - When an extra ₹10 is inserted at S3 (i.e., 25 total).
